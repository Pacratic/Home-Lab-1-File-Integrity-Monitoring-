<h1>Home Lab #1 Setting up file integrity monitoring</h1>



<h2>Why Is File Integrity Important?:</h2>

File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) plays a crucial role in maintaining the security and integrity of a system by actively detecting and alerting on unauthorized changes to critical files. Here's why FIM is an essential cybersecurity tool:<br />

<h2> Detecting Unauthorized Changes</h2>

FIM identifies and notifies users when critical system files are altered without authorization, helping prevent potential security breaches and ensuring system stability.<br />

<h2> Meeting Compliance Requirements </h2>

Many regulatory standards, such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR, mandate the use of FIM as part of an organization's compliance framework to protect sensitive data.<br />

<h2> Mitigating Insider Threats </h2>

By monitoring changes made by internal users, FIM can detect potential insider threats, enabling organizations to respond quickly and effectively to suspicious activity.<br />

Implementing FIM demonstrates a proactive approach to system security and regulatory compliance, making it a cornerstone of any robust cybersecurity strategy. <br />

<h1> Requirements:</h1>

 -Oracle VirtualBox Manager<br />
 -Windows10 VM <br />
 -Wazuh OVA File <br />
<br />

<h2> Step 1: Install Wazuh </h2>
For setting up your home lab, using the Wazuh OVA (Open Virtual Appliance) file is a straightforward and convenient option. The OVA file simplifies deployment by providing a pre-configured virtual machine image.<br />
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Step 2: Configure and Start Wazuh Virtual Machine in VirtualBox</h2> 

Once you have downloaded the Wazuh OVA file, follow these steps to set it up and ensure proper connectivity:<br />

Import the OVA File:<br />

Open VirtualBox. <br />

Go to File > Import Appliance. <br />

Select the downloaded Wazuh OVA file and click Next. <br />

Adjust the virtual machine settings as needed (e.g., memory or CPU allocation). <br />

Click Import to complete the process. <br />
<br />

Set Network to Bridge Mode: <br />

Select the imported Wazuh virtual machine in VirtualBox. <br />

Click Settings > Network. <br />

Under Adapter 1, ensure that: <br />

Enable Network Adapter is checked. <br />

Attached to is set to Bridged Adapter. <br />

Choose the correct network interface of your host machine (e.g., Ethernet or Wi-Fi). <br />

This configuration allows the virtual machine to obtain an IP address on the same network as your host machine, enabling direct access. <br />

<br />
<br />

<h2> Step 3: Log In to Wazuh CLI and Access the Web Interface</h2>
<br />
Log In to the Wazuh CLI: <br />
Open the Wazuh virtual machine console in VirtualBox. <br />

Use the default credentials to log in: <br />

Username: wazuh-user <br />
Password: wazuh <br />

Now that the login has been accepted we now need to run the ifconfig command <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />

Access the Wazuh Web Interface: <br />

Open your favorite web browser on the host machine. <br />

Enter the following URL, replacing <WAZUH_IP_ADDRESS> with the IP address you retrieved: Enter the following URL into your web browser, replacing <WAZUH_IP_ADDRESS> with 10.0.0.94 <br />

<br />
<br />

Use the default credentials: <br />

Username: admin <br />
Password: admin <br />

Once you log in, you'll have access to the Wazuh dashboard to begin configuring and managing your system. <br />

<br />
<br />


Configure Agent Installation:

Select Windows as the operating system. <br />

Enter your Wazuh Server's IP address (e.g., 10.0.0.94). <br />

Set an agent name (e.g., WindowsAgent01). <br />

<br />
<br />

Get the PowerShell Script: <br />

The Wazuh platform will generate a PowerShell script for installation. <br />

Copy the script to your Windows machine.<br />

<br />
<br />
Run the PowerShell Script on Windows:

Open PowerShell on your Windows machine with administrator privileges: <br />

Press Win + X and select Windows PowerShell (Admin). <br />
Paste the copied script into the PowerShell window and run it. <br />

<br />
<br />

Start the Wazuh Agent Service: <br />

Once the script completes, you will also be provided with a command to start the Wazuh Agent service. <br />

Run the provided command in PowerShell to activate the agent. <br />


Verify the Agent Status:<br />

Return to the Wazuh GUI on your browser.<br />

In the Agents section, ensure your newly added agent appears in the list and is marked as Connected.<br />

<h2>Lets configure the Wazuh agent to monitor the System32 folder</h2>

The Wazuh Agent Manager is the configuration file for the agent running on the machine you want to monitor. Youâ€™ll need to edit the configuration directly on the machine where the Wazuh Agent is installed.<br />

Steps to Access the Agent Manager Configuration: <br />

Log in to the Machine Running the Wazuh Agent <br />

Locate the Program Files lised for the ossec-agent <br />

Once found open the text editor within this file <br />

The <directories> tags in the <syscheck> block define the files and directories being monitored. To include the System32 directory for file integrity monitoring, you need to add an additional <directories> entry. <br/>
