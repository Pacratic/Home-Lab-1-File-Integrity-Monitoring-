<h1>Home Lab #1 Setting up file integrity monitoring</h1>



<h2>Why Is File Integrity Important?:</h2>

File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) plays a crucial role in maintaining the security and integrity of a system by actively detecting and alerting on unauthorized changes to critical files. Here's why FIM is an essential cybersecurity tool:<br />

<h2> Detecting Unauthorized Changes</h2>

FIM identifies and notifies users when critical system files are altered without authorization, helping prevent potential security breaches and ensuring system stability.<br />

<h2> Meeting Compliance Requirements </h2>

Many regulatory standards, such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR, mandate the use of FIM as part of an organization's compliance framework to protect sensitive data.<br />

<h2> Mitigating Insider Threats </h2>

By monitoring changes made by internal users, FIM can detect potential insider threats, enabling organizations to respond quickly and effectively to suspicious activity.<br />

Implementing FIM demonstrates a proactive approach to system security and regulatory compliance, making it a cornerstone of any robust cybersecurity strategy. <br />
